# Conflict Resolver

Ruby ðŸ’Ž tool for resolving conflicts in `db/structure.sql`

## Installation

```bash
gem install structure_conflict_resolver
```

You probably won't want to add this to your `Gemfile`, it's more of a CLI tool.

## Usage

When you run into a merge conflict on `db/structure.sql`, give this a try:

```bash
structure_conflict_resolver db/structure.sql
```

It'll smartly resolve any conflicts around the version numbers at the bottom.

Any logical conflicts in the actual table descriptions... you'll have to fix yourself!
