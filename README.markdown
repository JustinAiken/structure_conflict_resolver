# structure.sql Conflict Resolver

Ruby ðŸ’Ž tool for resolving conflicts in `db/structure.sql`

Do you hate it when this happens to you?

![Conflict Detected](doc/conflict.png)

Now you can easily resolve the most common conflicts in the versions list!

#### Before:

```sql
...

('20180313190020'),
<<<<<<< HEAD
('20180319155607');

=======
('20180319231815');
>>>>>>> some important commit
```

#### After:

```sql
...

('20180313190020'),
('20180319155607'),
('20180319231815');
```

## Installation

```bash
gem install structure_conflict_resolver
```

You probably won't want to add this to your `Gemfile`, it's more of a CLI tool.

## Usage

When you run into a merge conflict on `db/structure.sql`, give this a try:

```bash
structure_conflict_resolver db/structure.sql
```

It'll smartly resolve any conflicts around the version numbers at the bottom.

Any logical conflicts in the actual table descriptions... you'll have to fix yourself!
